# Linked List

## Introduction

A linked list is a linear data structure used in computer science and programming. It is a collection of nodes, where each node contains two parts:

1. Data : This is the actual value or element stored in the node.
2. Reference (or Link) : This is a reference or pointer to the next node in the sequence (in a singly linked list) or both the next and previous nodes (in a doubly linked list).

The nodes in a linked list are connected sequentially, with each node pointing to the next one. This structure allows for efficient insertion and deletion of elements, especially when compared to array-based data structures like Arrays or ArrayLists, where elements must be shifted to accommodate changes in the collection.
