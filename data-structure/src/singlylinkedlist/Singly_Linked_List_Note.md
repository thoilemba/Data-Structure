# Singly Linked List

In a singly linked list, each node contains one data part and one reference part where the reference  points to the next node in the sequence. The last node typically points to null, indicating the end of the list.

### Advantages  of Singly Linked List :

 - Memory Efficiency - Singly linked lists are more memory-efficient than doubly linked lists     	because they require only one pointer (the "next" pointer) per node.
 - Used in Stack, Queue implementation.

### Disadvantages  of Singly Linked List :

1. Time complexity of adding an element (except addFirst()) - O(n).
2. Time complexity of deleting an element (except removeFirst()) - O(n).
3. Reverse transversal is not possible.
